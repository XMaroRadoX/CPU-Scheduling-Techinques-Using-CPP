// REFRENCE IN QUESTION IS WILLAM STALLING BOOK Operating System 7th Edition

Input Format: 
 Line1 “trace” or “stats”. 
“trace” is used to ask your program to visualize the processes switching over the CPU – just like the 
Figure 9.5 in textbook (or slide 30 in the class presentation). You can see 01a-output.txt 
as an example. 
“stats” is used to ask your program to  write some statistics on the scheduled processes  – just like 
Table 9.5 in  textbook (or slide 31 in the class presentation). You can see 01b-output.txt 
as an example. 


Line2. a comma-separated list telling which CPU scheduling policies to be analyzed/visualized along with 
their  parameters,  if  applicable.  Each  algorithm  is  represented  by  a  number  as  listed  in  the 
introduction section and as shown in the attached testcases.  

Round Robin has a parameter specifying the quantum to be used. Therefore, a policy entered as 2-
4 means Round Robin with quantum = 4. 


Line3. An integer specifying the last instant to be used in your simulation and to be shown on the timeline. 

Line4. An integer specifying the number of processes to be simulated. None of the processes is making a blocking call. 

Line5. Start of description of processes. Each process is to be described on a separate line. For algorithms 
1 through 7, each process is described using a comma-separated list specifying: 
- One character specifying a process name 
- Arrival Time 
- Service Time
